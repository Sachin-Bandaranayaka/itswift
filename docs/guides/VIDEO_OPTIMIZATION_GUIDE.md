# Video Optimization Guide

## Current Issue
The homepage hero video (`Banner Video V3.mp4`) is 42MB, which causes slow loading times and poor user experience.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Code-Level Optimizations ✅
- **Preload Strategy**: Changed from `preload="auto"` to `preload="metadata"` to load only essential metadata first
- **Loading States**: Added loading spinner and error handling for better UX
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented delayed video loading (100ms after component mount) to improve initial page load
- **Smooth Transitions**: Added opacity transitions for seamless video appearance

### 2. Video Compression (Recommended)
Use the provided script to compress the video:

```bash
# Run the optimization script
./scripts/optimize-video.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a backup of the original video
- Compress the video using optimal web settings
- Reduce file size by approximately 60-80%
- Maintain good visual quality

### 3. Additional Recommendations

#### A. Multiple Video Formats
Consider creating multiple formats for better browser compatibility:
```html
<video>
  <source src="/banner-video.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/banner-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

#### B. Responsive Video Sizes
Create different video sizes for different screen sizes:
- Mobile: 720p (smaller file)
- Desktop: 1080p (current)
- 4K displays: 1440p (if needed)

#### C. CDN Delivery
Consider hosting the video on a CDN like:
- Cloudflare
- AWS CloudFront
- Vercel's built-in CDN

#### D. Video Poster Image
Add a poster image for instant visual feedback:
```html
<video poster="/video-poster.jpg">
```

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- File size: 42MB
- Loading time: 5-15 seconds (depending on connection)
- No loading feedback
- Poor mobile experience

### After Code Optimization
- Improved initial page load
- Better user feedback during loading
- Graceful error handling
- Smoother visual transitions

### After Video Compression (Expected)
- File size: 8-15MB (60-80% reduction)
- Loading time: 1-3 seconds
- Maintained visual quality
- Better mobile performance

## Implementation Steps

1. **Immediate** (Already Done):
   - ✅ Updated video component with loading states
   - ✅ Added preload optimization
   - ✅ Implemented lazy loading

2. **Next Steps**:
   - Run video compression script
   - Test loading performance
   - Consider adding poster image
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Implement responsive video sizes
   - Add WebM format support
   - Consider CDN hosting

## Testing

To test the improvements:
1. Open browser dev tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload the homepage
4. Monitor video loading time and user experience

## Monitoring

Keep track of these metrics:
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Should improve significantly
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Should remain good
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Should be minimal
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Should improve

## Troubleshooting

If video still loads slowly:
1. Check network connection
2. Verify video file size after compression
3. Consider using a different video format
4. Test on different devices and browsers
5. Monitor server response times
