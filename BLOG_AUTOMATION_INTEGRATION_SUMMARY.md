- Processes blog published triggers with comprehensive automation
- Generates social media posts for LinkedIn and Twitter automatically
- Tracks initial blog post analytics (views, likes, shares, comments)
- Handles errors gracefully without failing the blog publication process
- Extracts meaningful content from Sanity CMS block structure

### 2. Enhanced Blog Post Scheduler

**File**: `lib/services/blog-post-scheduler.ts`

**New Features Added**:
- `triggerBlogAutomation()` method that triggers automation after successful blog publication
