# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. useSearchParams Suspense Boundary Error
**Problem**: The `/unsubscribe` page was using `useSearchParams()` without a Suspense boundary, causing build failures.

**Solution**: 
- Wrapped the component using `useSearchParams()` in a `Suspense` boundary
- Created a separate `UnsubscribeContent` component for the main logic
- Added a loading fallback UI

**Files Modified**:
- `app/unsubscribe/page.tsx`

### 2. Dynamic Server Usage in API Routes
**Problem**: API routes were using dynamic server features during static generation, causing build errors.

**Solution**:
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to API routes that need dynamic behavior
- This prevents Next.js from trying to statically generate these routes

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/blog/posts/route.ts`
- `app/api/newsletter/subscriber-by-token/route.ts`

### 3. Missing automation_rules Table
**Problem**: The database health check and automation services were trying to access a missing `automation_rules` table during build.

**Solution**:
- Modified database health check to treat `automation_rules` as optional
- Updated automation rules service to handle missing table gracefully
- Added proper error handling for missing table scenarios

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/database/connection.ts`
- `lib/database/services/automation-rules.ts`

## Build Status
âœ… **Build now passes successfully**
- All static pages generate correctly
- No more dynamic server usage errors
- Missing table handled gracefully
- Suspense boundaries properly implemented

## Notes
- The automation features will work once the `automation_rules` table is created
- The build process now handles missing optional database tables gracefully
- All API routes that need dynamic behavior are properly configured
