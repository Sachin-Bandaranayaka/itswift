# Newsletter Sending Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Unsubscribe Tokens
**Error**: `Error creating unsubscribe link: Error: Subscriber not found or missing unsubscribe token`

**Root Cause**: Existing newsletter subscribers in the database were missing the `unsubscribe_token` field, which was added in a recent migration but not populated for existing records.

**Solution**: 
- Created `scripts/fix-newsletter-tokens.js` to generate secure unsubscribe tokens for all existing subscribers
- Fixed 3 subscribers that were missing tokens
- All active subscribers now have valid unsubscribe tokens

### 2. Missing Text Content for Brevo API
**Error**: `Brevo API error: { code: 'missing_parameter', message: 'textContent is missing' }`

**Root Cause**: The Brevo API requires both `htmlContent` and `textContent` parameters when sending emails, but the newsletter service was only providing HTML content.

**Solution**:
- Added `generateTextContent()` method in `NewsletterService` to convert HTML content to plain text
- Added `generateTextFromHtml()` method in `BrevoService` as a fallback for missing text content
- Updated the email sending flow to always include both HTML and text versions

## Files Modified

### 1. `scripts/fix-newsletter-tokens.js` (New)
- Script to identify and fix subscribers missing unsubscribe tokens
- Generates secure tokens using the same algorithm as the main application
- Includes verification to ensure all subscribers have tokens

### 2. `lib/services/newsletter.ts`
- Added `generateTextContent()` method to convert HTML to plain text
- Updated `sendCampaign()` to generate and pass text content to Brevo service
- Improved email content processing with proper text fallbacks

### 3. `lib/integrations/brevo.ts`
- Added `generateTextFromHtml()` method as a fallback for missing text content
- Updated `sendEmail()` method to automatically generate text content when missing
- Enhanced `sendBulkEmailWithUnsubscribe()` to handle text content properly

## Verification

### Unsubscribe Tokens
```bash
node scripts/fix-newsletter-tokens.js
```
**Result**: ✅ All 5 active subscribers now have unsubscribe tokens

### Newsletter Sending
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/newsletter/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"campaignId": "6c634d31-ff8d-4f2f-a5b2-abba55fbd2d0"}'
```
**Result**: ✅ Newsletter sent successfully to 5 recipients with message IDs returned

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Token Management**: All subscribers now have secure unsubscribe tokens
2. **Brevo API Compliance**: Both HTML and text content are provided for all emails
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic text content generation when HTML-only content is provided
4. **Error Prevention**: Proactive token generation for new subscribers
5. **Verification Tools**: Script to check and fix token issues in the future

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on newsletter sending to ensure no further issues
2. **Automation**: Consider adding the token fix script to deployment processes
3. **Enhancement**: Improve HTML-to-text conversion for better plain text emails
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for the new text content generation methods
