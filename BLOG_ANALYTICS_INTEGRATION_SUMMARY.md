- Added engagement rate calculations
- Included comprehensive metadata (word count, images, categories)
- Added performance scoring and ranking

**New analytics methods:**
- `getBlogPostMetrics()` - Individual post metrics
- `trackBlogPostView()` - View tracking placeholder
- `getBlogAnalyticsSummary()` - Comprehensive analytics overview

#### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Types (`lib/types/dashboard.ts`)

#### 3. New Blog Analytics Card Component (`components/admin/blog-analytics-card.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Displays top performing blog posts with metrics
- Shows engagement rates with color-coded badges
- Includes view, like, share, and comment metrics
- Displays author and category information
- Shows days since publication
- Responsive design with loading and error states

#### 4. Updated Dashboard Integration (`app/admin/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added BlogAnalyticsCard to the dashboard layout
- Updated stat cards to show more relevant blog metrics
- Enhanced blog post statistics display
- Improved error handling and loading states

#### 5. Fixed API Route Issues

**Updated routes with dynamic exports:**
- `app/api/admin/blog/scheduled/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin/blog/health/route.ts`
- `app/api/blog/posts/route.ts`

#### 6. Comprehensive Testing (`test/lib/services/blog-data-enhanced.test.ts`)

**Test coverage:**
- Blog statistics fetching and calculation
- Recent activity aggregation and sorting
- Scheduled posts with metadata
- Top performing posts with metrics
- Analytics summary generation
- Error handling scenarios
