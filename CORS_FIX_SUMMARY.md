# CORS Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
Your Next.js application was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to access the Sanity CMS API directly from the browser. The errors showed:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://q7zm6kfe.api.sanity.io/...' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## Root Cause
The Sanity API doesn't allow direct browser requests from localhost by default for security reasons. Your application was making client-side requests to Sanity, which triggered CORS restrictions.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Server-Side API Routes
Instead of making direct client-side requests to Sanity, we created Next.js API routes that handle Sanity queries server-side:

- **`/api/blog/posts`** - Fetches paginated blog posts with filtering
- **`/api/blog/categories`** - Fetches available categories  
- **`/api/blog/posts/[slug]`** - Fetches individual blog posts by slug

### 2. Created Blog API Client
Created `lib/services/blog-api-client.ts` to handle client-side API calls to our Next.js API routes instead of directly to Sanity.

### 3. Updated Components
- Updated `app/blog/blog-page-content.tsx` to use the new API client
- Updated `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to use the API client for individual posts

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
Added proper error handling and caching headers to the API routes for better performance and user experience.

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
- `app/api/blog/posts/route.ts`
- `app/api/blog/categories/route.ts` 
- `app/api/blog/posts/[slug]/route.ts`
- `lib/services/blog-api-client.ts`
- `test-api.js` (for testing)

### Files Modified:
- `app/blog/blog-page-content.tsx`
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
- `lib/queries.ts`
- `lib/sanity.client.ts`

## Alternative Solution (If Preferred)

If you prefer to keep direct Sanity client usage, you can also fix this by:

1. Going to your Sanity project dashboard at https://sanity.io/manage
2. Selecting your project (`q7zm6kfe`)
3. Going to **Settings** → **API** → **CORS Origins**
4. Adding `http://localhost:3000` to the allowed origins
5. Checking "Allow credentials" if needed

## Testing

To test the API routes, run:
```bash
node test-api.js
```

Make sure your Next.js development server is running on port 3000.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Security**: Server-side API calls are more secure
2. **Performance**: Can add caching headers and optimize queries
3. **Error Handling**: Better error handling and fallbacks
4. **SEO**: Server-side rendering works better for SEO
5. **Flexibility**: Can add additional processing or validation

## Next Steps

1. Test the blog pages to ensure they load properly
2. Remove the `test-api.js` file after testing
3. Consider adding more caching strategies if needed
4. Monitor performance and adjust as necessary

The CORS errors should now be resolved, and your blog should load properly from the server-side API routes.
