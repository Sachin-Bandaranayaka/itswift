# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The automation system has been fully implemented but has a critical database connection issue preventing it from functioning. Multiple services are importing `getSupabaseAdmin` correctly but then using `supabaseAdmin` directly instead of calling the function, causing "ReferenceError: supabaseAdmin is not defined" errors across all API endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database connections to work properly, so that all automation features can function without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service needs database access THEN it SHALL use the correct function call `getSupabaseAdmin()` instead of the undefined variable `supabaseAdmin`
2. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL not show any "supabaseAdmin is not defined" errors
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL successfully connect to the database
4. WHEN services import the Supabase client THEN they SHALL use the proper function calls consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent database client usage across all services, so that the codebase is maintainable and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service file uses Supabase THEN it SHALL call `getSupabaseAdmin()` function instead of using `supabaseAdmin` variable
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all database service files SHALL follow the same pattern for client initialization
3. WHEN new services are added THEN they SHALL follow the established pattern for database connections
4. WHEN the application starts THEN all database connections SHALL be properly initialized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the admin panel, I want all automation features to work properly, so that I can manage content, social media, and newsletters without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin dashboard THEN all data SHALL load without database connection errors
2. WHEN creating social media posts THEN they SHALL be saved to the database successfully
3. WHEN managing newsletter subscribers THEN the operations SHALL complete without errors
4. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the data SHALL be retrieved from the database correctly
