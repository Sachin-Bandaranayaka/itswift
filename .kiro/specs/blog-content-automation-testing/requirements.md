# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The blog content automation system needs comprehensive testing and integration to ensure that blog posts created through the admin interface properly appear on the public blog page. Currently, there's a disconnect between the static blog page and the dynamic Sanity CMS-powered admin system. This feature will establish a complete end-to-end workflow for blog content creation, scheduling, and publication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to create blog posts through the admin interface and see them automatically appear on the public blog page, so that I can manage content efficiently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a blog post through the admin interface THEN the system SHALL save the post to Sanity CMS with all required fields
2. WHEN a blog post is published (publishedAt date is current or past) THEN the system SHALL display it on the public blog page at /blog
3. WHEN a blog post is scheduled for future publication THEN the system SHALL NOT display it on the public blog page until the scheduled time
4. WHEN the public blog page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all published posts from Sanity CMS instead of static data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to test the blog post creation and scheduling functionality, so that I can verify the system works correctly before relying on it for production content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to create at least 3 sample blog posts with different publication statuses (published, scheduled, draft)
2. WHEN a blog post is created with a past publishedAt date THEN the system SHALL immediately display it on the public blog page
3. WHEN a blog post is created with a future publishedAt date THEN the system SHALL show it as "scheduled" in the admin interface but not on the public page
4. WHEN a blog post is created without a publishedAt date THEN the system SHALL treat it as a draft and not display it publicly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to verify that the scheduler and automation system properly handles blog post publication, so that scheduled content is published automatically at the correct time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post is scheduled for publication THEN the system SHALL automatically make it visible on the public blog page when the scheduled time arrives
2. WHEN the scheduler runs THEN the system SHALL process all scheduled blog posts and update their publication status
3. WHEN testing the scheduler THEN the administrator SHALL be able to create a post scheduled for immediate publication (1-2 minutes in the future) to verify automation works
4. WHEN the automation system processes scheduled content THEN the system SHALL log the activity for monitoring and debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see the latest blog posts with proper formatting and metadata on the blog page, so that I can read current and relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting the blog page THEN the system SHALL display all published posts in reverse chronological order (newest first)
2. WHEN displaying blog posts THEN the system SHALL show the title, excerpt, publication date, author, and categories for each post
3. WHEN a blog post has an associated image THEN the system SHALL display it as a thumbnail or header image
4. WHEN clicking on a blog post THEN the system SHALL navigate to the individual post page with full content
5. IF no published posts exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no content is available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to monitor blog post performance and activity through the admin dashboard, so that I can track content effectiveness and system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display blog post statistics including total posts, posts published this month, and growth metrics
2. WHEN checking recent activity THEN the system SHALL show the latest blog post publications and scheduled posts
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to see any errors or issues with blog post processing
4. WHEN posts are automatically published by the scheduler THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard metrics in real-time
