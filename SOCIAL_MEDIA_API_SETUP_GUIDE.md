TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_actual_access_token_here
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_actual_access_token_secret_here
```

## Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit API keys to version control**
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive credentials
3. **Rotate keys regularly** for security
4. **Monitor API usage** to detect unauthorized access
5. **Use HTTPS** for all callback URLs in production

## Rate Limits and Considerations

### LinkedIn API Limits
- **Posts**: 100 posts per day per person
- **Rate limiting**: 500 requests per day for most endpoints
- **Content guidelines**: Must comply with LinkedIn's professional content standards

### Twitter API Limits
- **Tweets**: 300 tweets per 15-minute window
- **API calls**: Varies by endpoint (typically 15-300 requests per 15-minute window)
- **Content guidelines**: Must comply with Twitter's automation rules

## Testing Your Setup

After obtaining all credentials:

1. Update your `.env.local` file with real values
2. Restart your development server
3. Test the social media posting functionality
4. Verify posts appear correctly on both platforms

## Troubleshooting

### Common LinkedIn Issues
- **App not approved**: Ensure your use case clearly explains content automation needs
- **Invalid redirect URI**: Double-check callback URLs match exactly
- **Scope errors**: Verify you have the correct API products approved

### Common Twitter Issues
- **Authentication errors**: Ensure all 4 credentials are correct
- **Permission denied**: Check app permissions are set to "Read and Write"
- **Rate limit exceeded**: Implement proper rate limiting in your application
